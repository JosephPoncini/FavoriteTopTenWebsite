// Peer Reviewed Comments: Website looks supeerrrr nice, and neet. I like all the pictures and icons they used for their website. However looking at their figma, it's not exactly a 1 to 1 ratio. There are many things they have in their website that they dont have in their figma, for example, the number of cards, the videos, the texts, the home nav bar button function, the carousel, the hamburger nav bar for their tablet version, and their background picture. Also when I put there website into the tablet size that they have on their figma, it didn't look the same, I had to shrink it a little further down than the tablet size for it to look a similar, and when I do that, the videos turn into video links. So I just suggest they fix their figma and maybe the tablet responsiveness. Other than that though, I love their website and I think they did a great job!
